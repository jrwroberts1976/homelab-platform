## AI-assisted host assessment

> Advisory interpretation of bounded host evidence. Canonical inventory and direct telemetry remain authoritative.

- Assessed: `2026-11-03T17:00:11+00:00`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `bc:24:11:c3:75:ba`
- Identity confidence: **high**
- OS confidence: **low**
- Exact OS: **Not established**
- Manual review required: **No**

### Assessment summary

dns-01 is the managed CT101 Pi-hole and Unbound container on Proxmox-2. It is online with no pending updates, no reboot required, and no matching actionable Greenbone findings. Exact guest OS is not available.

### Confirmed facts

- Canonical estate identity is dns-01.
- The device is an LXC container, CT101 on Proxmox-2.
- Its documented role is Pi-hole and Unbound.
- It is managed by Ansible.
- The hostname is dns-01.jameshouse and the current IP is 192.168.2.51.
- Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH is reported as the vendor.
- The device is online.
- No security or general updates are available, and no reboot is required.
- No actionable Greenbone findings match the current IP.
- The bounded Loki sample contains entries from pihole and systemd-journal, with no warning or error samples.

### Inferences

- The host is a virtualized service container rather than a directly identified physical appliance.
- The guest operating system or firmware cannot be determined from the supplied evidence.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
