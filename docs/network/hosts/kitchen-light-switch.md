> Persistent private device record generated from the live network-detail audit on 29 September 2026. Keep secrets, raw packet captures and complete household browsing history out of Git.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Address | `192.168.2.167` |
| MAC | `f8:17:2d:64:ca:04` |
| DHCP / discovered hostname | `kitchen-light-switch.jameshouse` |
| MAC vendor | Not yet known |
| Online at audit | True |
| Stable identity key | MAC |

## Profiling and platform evidence

- Deep-profile status: `baseline`
- Nmap OS evidence: 0 Nmap match(es), needs_os=None
- Observed TCP-port summary: 0 open TCP port(s)
- Automatic device hint: None yet
- Details still to investigate: vendor,OS,ports,DNS,device-type

A `baseline` profile means the controlled seven-day backlog has not yet supplied the targeted profile for this device. Zero ports in this summary is therefore not proof that no ports are open.

## Network flows

<!-- BEGIN AUTO:ZEEK-FLOW -->
### Automated Zeek summary

- Zeek flow evidence is not configured for this estate.

> No absence-of-traffic conclusion is made when the Zeek source is unavailable.

## Internet / DNS activity

| Signal / service family | Evidence | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| No bounded DNS signal recorded yet | automatic dual-Pi-hole evidence | Review with other evidence before identifying the device |

Use service/domain-family summaries here, not raw Pi-hole history. DNS resolution does not prove a person visited a website.

## AI-assisted host assessment

> Advisory interpretation of bounded host evidence. Canonical inventory and direct telemetry remain authoritative.

- Assessed: `2026-10-01T10:03:30+01:00`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `f8:17:2d:64:ca:04`
- Identity confidence: **low**
- OS confidence: **low**
- Exact OS: **Not established**
- Manual review required: **Yes**

### Assessment summary

Online host at 192.168.2.167 with the documented kitchen-light-switch hostname, but DHCP identifies it only as wlan0. No vendor, service, Nmap OS, DNS, or telemetry evidence is available to confirm device identity or platform.

### Confirmed facts

- The host is online at 192.168.2.167.
- The inventory hostname is kitchen-light-switch.jameshouse and the telemetry hostname is kitchen-light-switch.
- The router reports DHCP hostname wlan0 for this IP.
- The MAC address is f8:17:2d:64:ca:04; no vendor is supplied.
- Nmap OS and port evidence is unavailable because the scan is partial and reports os_evidence_missing.
- No actionable Greenbone findings match the current IP.
- No sampled Loki entries or Zeek connections are present in the supplied bounded data.

### Inferences

- The hostname suggests this may be a kitchen light switch or related IoT device.
- The device may use embedded IoT firmware, but no operating-system evidence supports that conclusion.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
