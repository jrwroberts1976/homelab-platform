- Assessed: `2026-10-08T14:00:32+01:00`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `b8:27:eb:e8:36:cd`
- Identity confidence: **high**
- OS confidence: **high**
- Exact OS: **Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)**
- Manual review required: **No**

### Assessment summary

admin-01 is a managed Raspberry Pi 3 administration and SSH jump host running authoritative Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie) on aarch64. OpenSSH is confirmed on TCP/22; TCP/111 and TCP/9100 are also open. No matching actionable Greenbone findings or pending security updates were reported.

### Confirmed facts

- The canonical estate identifies admin-01 as a physical Raspberry Pi 3 administration, SSH jump, IaC controller, and Corosync QNetd host.
- The device vendor is Raspberry Pi Foundation.
- The authoritative Zabbix Agent 2 inventory reports Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), kernel 6.18.50+rpt-rpi-v8, and architecture aarch64.
- The hostname is admin-01.jameshouse and the current IP is 192.168.2.48.
- TCP/22 is open and provides corroborated OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 7+deb13u4 using protocol 2.0.
- TCP/111 and TCP/9100 are open; their Nmap service labels were omitted.
- Greenbone reports zero matching actionable findings for the current host IP.
- Patch telemetry reports zero available security updates, no reboot required, and enabled unattended upgrades.

### Inferences

- The host is a Raspberry Pi 3 running 64-bit Debian Linux, consistent with the authoritative architecture and canonical role.
- The device is likely a centrally managed infrastructure administration host, consistent with its Ansible management and documented estate role.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
