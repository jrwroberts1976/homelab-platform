# main-tv

> Persistent private device record generated from the live network-detail audit on 29 September 2026. Keep secrets, raw packet captures and complete household browsing history out of Git.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Address | `192.168.2.234` |
| MAC | `5c:34:00:50:df:b3` |
| DHCP / discovered hostname | `main-tv.jameshouse` |
| MAC vendor | Hisense Electric |
| Online at audit | False |
| Stable identity key | MAC |

## Profiling and platform evidence

- Deep-profile status: `partial`
- Nmap OS evidence: 0 Nmap match(es), needs_os=True
- Observed TCP-port summary: 0 open TCP port(s)
- Automatic device hint: None yet
- Details still to investigate: OS,ports,DNS,device-type

A `baseline` profile means the controlled seven-day backlog has not yet supplied the targeted profile for this device. Zero ports in this summary is therefore not proof that no ports are open.

- Observed IP address(es): `192.168.2.234`
- Connections: **1,344**
- Traffic sent: **1.4 MiB**
- Traffic received: **1.5 MiB**
- Top services: `ssl` (127), `http` (28), `dns` (12), `dhcp` (4), `ntp` (4)
- Top destination ports: `udp/1900` (971), `udp/443` (181), `tcp/443` (135), `tcp/80` (27), `udp/53` (12), `tcp/1883` (4)

## Internet / DNS activity

| Signal / service family | Evidence | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| No bounded DNS signal recorded yet | automatic dual-Pi-hole evidence | Review with other evidence before identifying the device |

Use service/domain-family summaries here, not raw Pi-hole history. DNS resolution does not prove a person visited a website.
