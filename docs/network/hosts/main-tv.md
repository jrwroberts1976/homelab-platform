> Persistent private device record generated from the live network-detail audit on 29 September 2026. Keep secrets, raw packet captures and complete household browsing history out of Git.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Address | `192.168.2.234` |
| MAC | `5c:34:00:50:df:b3` |
| DHCP / discovered hostname | `main-tv.jameshouse` |
| MAC vendor | Hisense Electric |
| Online at audit | False |
| Stable identity key | MAC |

## Profiling and platform evidence

- Deep-profile status: `partial`
- Nmap OS evidence: 0 Nmap match(es), needs_os=True
- Observed TCP-port summary: 0 open TCP port(s)
- Automatic device hint: None yet
- Details still to investigate: OS,ports,DNS,device-type

A `baseline` profile means the controlled seven-day backlog has not yet supplied the targeted profile for this device. Zero ports in this summary is therefore not proof that no ports are open.

### Automated Zeek summary

- Zeek flow evidence is not configured for this estate.

## Internet / DNS activity

| Signal / service family | Evidence | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| No bounded DNS signal recorded yet | automatic dual-Pi-hole evidence | Review with other evidence before identifying the device |

Use service/domain-family summaries here, not raw Pi-hole history. DNS resolution does not prove a person visited a website.

## AI-assisted host assessment

> Advisory interpretation of bounded host evidence. Canonical inventory and direct telemetry remain authoritative.

- Assessed: `2026-10-08T12:04:32+01:00`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `5c:34:00:50:df:b3`
- Identity confidence: **high**
- OS confidence: **low**
- Exact OS: **Not established**
- Manual review required: **No**

### Assessment summary

Likely Hisense smart TV using VIDAA-related services. Exact operating system is unavailable; Nmap provided no OS evidence.

### Confirmed facts

- The inventory hostname is main-tv.jameshouse.
- The recorded vendor is Hisense Electric.
- DNS samples include multiple vidaahub.com domains, plus YouTube and Netflix domains.
- The device is currently online at 192.168.2.234.
- Nmap status is partial with no OS matches or port results.
- No actionable Greenbone findings currently match this IP; this is not proof that the host is vulnerability-free.

### Inferences

- The device is most likely a Hisense smart TV.
- The observed VIDAA-related DNS activity is consistent with embedded TV firmware, but does not establish an exact operating system or version.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
