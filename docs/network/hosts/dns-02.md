- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `bc:24:11:35:3b:11`

- Manual review required: **No**

### Assessment summary

dns-02 is CT100 on PROXMOX, running Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie) and serving Pi-hole/Unbound DNS. SSH and DNS are corroborated; ports 80, 443, and 9100 are open. Three updates are available, with no pending security updates or matching Greenbone findings.

### Confirmed facts

- The canonical estate identity is dns-02, an LXC container designated for Pi-hole and Unbound, CT100 on PROXMOX.
- The Proxmox cluster identifies the guest as LXC dns-02 on node PROXMOX with VMID 100.
- Authoritative Zabbix Agent 2 facts report Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), x86_64, kernel 7.0.14-23-pve.
- OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 7+deb13u4 is available on TCP port 22.
- dnsmasq 2.93 is available on TCP port 53 with Pi-hole noted.
- TCP ports 80, 443, and 9100 are open; their Nmap labels were omitted.
- The TCP 443 service is recorded as corroborated WebDAV over TLS, and the certificate identifies pi.hole.
- There are 3 updates available, 0 security updates available, and no reboot is required.
- Greenbone reports zero actionable findings matching this host IP.

### Inferences

- The host is a managed infrastructure service container rather than a standalone physical device.
- Its primary network function is local DNS filtering and resolution through Pi-hole and Unbound.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
