> Persistent private device record generated from the live network-detail audit on 29 September 2026. Keep secrets, raw packet captures and complete household browsing history out of Git.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Address | `192.168.2.206` |
| MAC | `16:c1:05:ad:4b:8a` |
| DHCP / discovered hostname | `james-phone.jameshouse` |
| MAC vendor | Not attributable by OUI (locally administered MAC) |
| Online at audit | True |
| Stable identity key | MAC |

## Profiling and platform evidence

- Deep-profile status: `baseline`
- Nmap OS evidence: 0 Nmap match(es), needs_os=None
- Observed TCP-port summary: 0 open TCP port(s)
- Automatic device hint: None yet
- Details still to investigate: vendor,OS,ports,DNS,device-type

A `baseline` profile means the controlled seven-day backlog has not yet supplied the targeted profile for this device. Zero ports in this summary is therefore not proof that no ports are open.

## Network flows

<!-- BEGIN AUTO:ZEEK-FLOW -->
### Automated Zeek summary

- Zeek flow evidence is not configured for this estate.

> No absence-of-traffic conclusion is made when the Zeek source is unavailable.

## Internet / DNS activity

| Signal / service family | Evidence | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| No bounded DNS signal recorded yet | automatic dual-Pi-hole evidence | Review with other evidence before identifying the device |

Use service/domain-family summaries here, not raw Pi-hole history. DNS resolution does not prove a person visited a website.

## AI-assisted host assessment

> Advisory interpretation of bounded host evidence. Canonical inventory and direct telemetry remain authoritative.

- Assessed: `2026-11-03T17:00:11+00:00`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `16:c1:05:ad:4b:8a`
- Identity confidence: **low**
- OS confidence: **low**
- Exact OS: **Not established**
- Manual review required: **Yes**

### Assessment summary

Online host at 192.168.2.198 with MAC 16:c1:05:ad:4b:8a, but no hostname, vendor, service, DNS, or OS-identification evidence is available. Device identity requires review.

### Confirmed facts

- The host IP is 192.168.2.198.
- The observed MAC address is 16:c1:05:ad:4b:8a.
- The inventory reports the host as online.
- Nmap baseline completed with no TCP or UDP ports reported and no OS matches.
- No vendor was reported by inventory or Nmap.
- No matching actionable Greenbone findings were reported for the current IP.
- No recent policy-matched DNS activity was reported.

### Inferences

- The device identity and platform cannot be determined from the supplied evidence.
- No exact operating system or firmware is supported by the supplied evidence.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
