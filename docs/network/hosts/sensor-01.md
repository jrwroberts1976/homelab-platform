### Assessment summary

sensor-01 is VM201 on PROXMOX, managed by Ansible and used as a Suricata/Zeek passive network sensor. It runs authoritative Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie) on x86_64. Open services include corroborated OpenSSH on TCP/22 and an open TCP/9100 port with no usable Nmap service label. Three updates are available and a reboot is required; no matching actionable Greenbone findings were reported.

### Confirmed facts

- Canonical estate identity is sensor-01, a VM with role Suricata and Zeek passive network sensor, VM201 on PROXMOX.
- The Proxmox inventory identifies the guest as QEMU VM201 named sensor-01.
- Authoritative Zabbix Agent 2 facts report Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), x86_64, kernel 6.12.107+deb13-amd64.
- The host is online at 192.168.2.55 and has hostname sensor-01.jameshouse.
- TCP/22 is open and provides OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 7+deb13u4 using protocol 2.0.
- TCP/9100 is open; the supplied Nmap evidence omits its service label.
- Patching telemetry reports three updates available, zero security updates available, and a reboot required.
- Greenbone reported zero matching actionable findings for the current host IP.

### Inferences

- The host is a Linux-based managed infrastructure VM supporting network-security monitoring workloads.
- The Proxmox vendor attribution and QEMU guest metadata indicate virtualization rather than a physical endpoint.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
