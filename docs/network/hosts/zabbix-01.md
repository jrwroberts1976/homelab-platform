### Assessment summary

Authoritative inventory identifies this host as zabbix-01, an LXC container CT105 on PROXMOX running Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie). It serves the Zabbix monitoring platform with PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, Zabbix Server, Agent 2 and Nginx. SSH, HTTP on ports 80 and 8080, and an open port 9100 are present.

### Confirmed facts

- The hostname is zabbix-01.jameshouse and the IP address is 192.168.2.59.
- The canonical estate record identifies zabbix-01 as LXC container CT105 on PROXMOX.
- Authoritative Zabbix Agent 2 facts report Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), x86_64, with kernel 7.0.14-17-pve.
- The canonical role is a Zabbix monitoring platform with PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Zabbix Server, Agent 2 and Nginx active.
- TCP ports 22, 80, 8080 and 9100 are open.
- OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 7+deb13u4 is confirmed on TCP port 22.
- Nginx is confirmed on TCP ports 80 and 8080.
- Greenbone reported zero matching actionable findings for the current host IP at collection time.
- Patch telemetry reports 8 security updates and 36 total updates available; a reboot is not required.

### Inferences

- This is a managed Linux monitoring server hosted as a Proxmox LXC guest.
- Port 9100 may support a monitoring or printing-related service, but its service identity is not established by the supplied evidence.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
