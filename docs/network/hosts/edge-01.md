## AI-assisted host assessment

> Advisory interpretation of bounded host evidence. Canonical inventory and direct telemetry remain authoritative.

- Assessed: `2026-10-08T15:00:50+01:00`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `bc:24:11:8d:1b:c1`
- Identity confidence: **high**
- OS confidence: **high**
- Exact OS: **Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)**
- Manual review required: **No**

### Assessment summary

Managed Debian 13 LXC container edge-01 (CT103) on Proxmox-2. OpenSSH is exposed on TCP/22 and TCP/9100 is open. No actionable Greenbone findings or pending security updates were reported; sampled logs include SSH authentication failures and network-wait errors.

### Confirmed facts

- The canonical estate identity is edge-01, a reserved edge LXC, CT103 on Proxmox-2.
- The container is managed by Ansible.
- Authoritative Zabbix Agent 2 facts identify the OS as Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), architecture x86_64, with kernel 7.0.14-20-pve.
- The vendor is Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH.
- TCP/22 is open and provides corroborated OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 7+deb13u4 using protocol 2.0.
- TCP/9100 is open; its Nmap service label was omitted.
- Greenbone reported zero matching actionable findings for 192.168.2.56.
- Patch telemetry reports zero available updates, zero available security updates, and no reboot required.
- The sampled 24-hour logs include SSH authentication failures and network connectivity wait errors.

### Inferences

- The host is a Debian Linux guest environment running as a Proxmox LXC container rather than a physical device.
- The exposed SSH service supports administrative access, but no additional function is inferred from TCP/9100.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
