### Assessment summary

Authoritative inventory identifies this host as monitor-01, a Debian 13 QEMU VM on Proxmox-2 providing monitoring and network-discovery services. SSH and Grafana are corroborated; two updates and a reboot are pending.

### Confirmed facts

- The device is named monitor-01 and has IP address 192.168.2.52.
- The canonical estate record identifies it as a VM managed by Ansible.
- The VM is hosted on Proxmox-2 as QEMU guest VM202.
- Authoritative Zabbix Agent 2 facts report Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), x86_64, kernel 6.12.107+deb13-cloud-amd64.
- The canonical role includes Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Blackbox, Loki, and active network discovery.
- TCP port 22 provides corroborated OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 7+deb13u4.
- TCP port 3000 provides corroborated Grafana HTTP service.
- TCP port 9100 is open; no service label is supplied.
- No actionable Greenbone findings currently match this host IP.
- Two updates are available, zero security updates are reported, and a reboot is required.

### Inferences

- The device is a managed monitoring and observability collector rather than a typical end-user workstation.
- The reported vendor corresponds to the Proxmox virtualized platform; the guest operating system is Debian.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
