## AI-assisted host assessment

> Advisory interpretation of bounded host evidence. Canonical inventory and direct telemetry remain authoritative.

- Assessed: `2026-10-08T15:00:50+01:00`
- Model: `gpt-5.6-luna`
- MAC identity: `bc:24:11:0b:16:a2`
- Identity confidence: **high**
- OS confidence: **high**
- Exact OS: **Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)**
- Manual review required: **No**

### Assessment summary

Authoritative inventory identifies monitor-01 as VM202 on Proxmox-2, running Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie). It hosts the monitoring stack, with corroborated OpenSSH on port 22 and Grafana HTTP on port 3000; two security updates are pending.

### Confirmed facts

- The canonical estate record identifies the device as monitor-01, kind VM, managed by Ansible.
- The Proxmox cluster API identifies it as QEMU guest monitor-01, VMID 202, on Proxmox-2.
- The MAC vendor is Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH.
- Authoritative Zabbix Agent 2 facts report Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), x86_64, kernel 6.12.111+deb13-cloud-amd64.
- The documented estate role is Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Blackbox, Loki, and active network discovery.
- TCP port 22 exposes corroborated OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 7+deb13u4.
- TCP port 3000 exposes corroborated Grafana HTTP.
- TCP port 9100 is open; its Nmap service label was omitted.
- Greenbone reports zero matching actionable findings for the current host IP; this is not proof that the host is vulnerability-free.
- Patching telemetry reports two available security updates, unattended upgrades enabled, and no reboot required.

### Inferences

- The device is a managed monitoring and observability server hosted as a Proxmox QEMU VM.
- The authoritative Debian inventory is more reliable for OS identification than the unavailable Nmap OS profile.

> Greenbone zero-match results are not proof that a host is vulnerability-free. Nmap service labels and OS fingerprints remain evidence, not authoritative identity, unless corroborated.
