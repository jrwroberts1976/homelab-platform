# james-lt

> Persistent private device record generated from the live network-detail audit on 29 September 2026. Keep secrets, raw packet captures and complete household browsing history out of Git.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Address | `192.168.2.183` |
| MAC | `24:b2:b9:30:f8:55` |
| DHCP / discovered hostname | `james-lt.jameshouse` |
| MAC vendor | Not yet known |
| Online at audit | True |
| Stable identity key | MAC |

## Profiling and platform evidence

- Deep-profile status: `baseline`
- Nmap OS evidence: 0 Nmap match(es), needs_os=None
- Observed TCP-port summary: 0 open TCP port(s)
- Automatic device hint: None yet
- Details still to investigate: vendor,OS,ports,DNS,device-type

A `baseline` profile means the controlled seven-day backlog has not yet supplied the targeted profile for this device. Zero ports in this summary is therefore not proof that no ports are open.

## Internet / DNS activity

| Signal / service family | Evidence | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| No bounded DNS signal recorded yet | automatic dual-Pi-hole evidence | Review with other evidence before identifying the device |

Use service/domain-family summaries here, not raw Pi-hole history. DNS resolution does not prove a person visited a website.
